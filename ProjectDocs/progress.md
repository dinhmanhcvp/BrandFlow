# BrandFlow Subagent-Driven Progress

## CURRENT STATUS: IN PROGRESS

### 2026-04-12
- Redesigned the B2B Strategy Planning UI structure to strictly match the 23-form requirement.
- Fixed `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx` to include accurate multi-level navigation for all Phase A, Phase B, and Phase C forms using internationalization (i18n).
- Created missing UI layouts and Next.js routes for Phase A (`a2-performance`, `a4-market`, `a7-assumptions`, `a8-strategies`, `a9-budget`).
- Established generic `PastelTable.tsx` and `InstructionAlert.tsx` to ensure visual consistency identical to the design mockups.
- Fully implemented high-fidelity UI for `a1-mission` (Role/Competence + Future Direction toggles).
- Fully implemented high-fidelity UI for `a3-revenue` (Financial Table + Animated Charts mock).
- Fully implemented high-fidelity UI for `a5-swot` (Weighted KSF Table with matching pastel row/columns).

- Fully implemented high fidelity mock data UI for Phase B (`b1-objectives`, `b2-action`, `b3-budget`, `b4-contingency`, `b5-pnl`, `b6-gantt`).
- Fully implemented high fidelity mock data UI for Phase C HQ Dashboard (`c1-direction`, `c2-history`, `c3-issues`, `c4-dashboard`).
- Data mapped completely from the user's provided SBU/Product mock list. This completes the entire Marketing Plan UI integration.

### UX UPGRADES
- Deprecated inline AIExplainer in favor of a global floating `MascotChatbot.tsx`.
- The MascotChatbot automatically jumps into view when forms are opened, summarizing the purpose and offering localized jargon translations.
- **AI Brain Connected:** Upgraded `MascotChatbot` to wire into the `/api/agent` Node backend. It now acts as a true generative Co-pilot, allowing users to type custom marketing question prompts dynamically.
- Added generic `WizardNavigation.tsx` (Next/Prev links) at the bottom of pages to bridge missing logical connections.
- Designed 3 high-impact **Phase Overview Dashboards** (`a0`, `b0`, `c0`) as Landing Pages for each Phase, effectively structuring the user mental model before form entry.

### DATABASE & API
- **SQLAlchemy + SQLite/PostgreSQL:** Built a robust, scalable multi-tenant SQL database architecture (`app/core/database.py` and `app/models/models.py`).
- **Complete CRUD Service:** Built `app/services/form_crud.py` handling Project and 23-Form Data with Optimistic Locking and Bulk auto-save capabilities.
- **FastAPI Endpoints:** Created comprehensive `/api/v1/forms/*` router in `app/api/form_routes.py`. Tested and fully operational.

### NEXT STEPS
- Connect React Frontend to the new CRUD API via Zustand store.
- Replace mock data placeholders with dynamic React state mapping using the new database endpoints.
